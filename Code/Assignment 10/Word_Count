#Word Count Program

#PROBLEM:
#Design a program to read a file's words and count how many times a word appears. Final result will show top 10 words that appear the the frequency that they appear in.
#ALGORITHM:
#   1. User will choice a crime file to open
#   2. Creating a dictionaries from the file using lowercase forms of the word and counting how many times they appear within the file
#   3. If the word is already in the dictionary key the value will be increased by 1
#   4. If the word does not already have a key in the dictionary, a new key will be created and the value set to 1
#   5. A new list will be created by sorting from highest frequency to lowest from the dictionary by it's values (frequency)
#   6. By iterating through the new list the top 10 frequently used words will print
#   7. Again, the new list will be interated through and a count will keep track of how many words have a value of 1
#   8. By finding the length(amount of elements) of the list we find the amount of unquie words
#ERROR HANDLING:
#   All non-alphabetic will be removed from the list before entered into a dictionary
